Thank you for considering contributing to **Linux-Rookie-Utilities**! This project is designed to make life easier for Linux beginners while encouraging them to learn and explore on their own. 

We believe that the best way to learn Linux is by experimenting, solving problems, and discovering solutions. Therefore, **this repository is not meant to spoonfeed solutions but to provide helpful utilities and guidance**.

## Guidelines for Contributions

1. **Keep It Beginner-Friendly**:
   - Write clear and concise code with comments explaining what it does.

2. **Donâ€™t Spoonfeed**:
   - Avoid solving every possible problem or automating everything.
   - Leave room for beginners to explore and learn on their own.

   - Update the `README.md` file to explain what your script does and how to use it.
   - Add comments in your code to help beginners understand it.

4. **Encourage Learning**:
   - If you add a script, consider including a section in the `README.md` or comments explaining:
     - Why the script is useful.
     - How it works.
     - What the user can do to customize or extend it.

5. **Be Respectful**:
